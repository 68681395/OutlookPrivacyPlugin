#summary How we call perform crypto operations

= OPP Crypto =

The original plugin tried to call gpg.exe directly using streams.  This was sketchy at best.  I have recently re-written the crypto code to use the gpgme-sharp library.  This is a wrapper around the GPGME library.

Currently to my knowledge, GPGME is the recommended way to use GPG.  This is the same library used by the GPG4WIN project.

The current code is very clean and should not introduce any injection, oracle, or timing related attacks that are not already present in GPGME.
